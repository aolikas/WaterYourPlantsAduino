# WaterYourPlantsAduino
Arduino Sketch for controlling Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensors.
These Arduino sketches are a part of the IoT project - Water Your Plants. This project consists of three parts:
1. Water your Plants - an Android App based on Realtime Firebase that can receive sensor signals and control to a level of watering.  
2. SoilMoistureTemperatureSensors - Arduino sketch which sends data from Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor to the Realtime Firebase DB.
3. WaterPumpSensors - Arduino sketch, which is controlled by Android App.
