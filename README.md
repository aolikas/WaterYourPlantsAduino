# WaterYourPlantsAduino
This folder contains the Arduino source code and schemas for the Water Your Plants App.

# Introduction
These Arduino sketches are a part of the IoT project - Water Your Plants. This project consists of three parts:
1. Water your Plants - an Android App based on Realtime Firebase that can receive sensor signals and control to a level of watering.  
2. SoilMoistureTemperatureSensors - Arduino sketch which sends data from Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor to the Realtime Firebase DB.
3. WaterPumpSensors - Arduino sketch, which is controlled by Android App. 

# Get Started
1. Before your start, be sure that you already have Water Your Plants App on your phone. If no, [check this.](https://github.com/aolikas/WaterYourPlants)
2. Install Arduino IDE, if you don't already have it.
3. Download the sample.

# SoilMoistureTemperatureSensors
  Hardware:
  1. Capacitive moisture sensor. It's better to calibrate it before use.
